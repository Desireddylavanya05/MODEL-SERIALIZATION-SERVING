# MODEL-SERIALIZATION-SERVING

🧠 Model Serialization & Serving
📁 Repository Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on model serialization and serving machine learning models, a crucial step in deploying ML solutions to production. The notebook guides you through the process of saving trained models, loading them efficiently, and preparing them for real-time or batch inference.

📌 Key Highlights
✅ Model Training
Train a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, etc.) on a sample dataset using scikit-learn.

✅ Model Serialization
Learn how to serialize (save) trained models using:

joblib

pickle

✅ Model Deserialization & Prediction
Understand how to load the saved models and use them to make predictions on new data without retraining.

✅ Serving the Model
Build a simple API using:

Flask or FastAPI
to serve the model as a RESTful endpoint, enabling real-world application integration.

✅ Testing API Endpoints
Use tools like Postman or Python’s requests library to test the deployed model endpoints.

✅ Clean & Modular Code
Follows good programming practices for reusability and clarity.
